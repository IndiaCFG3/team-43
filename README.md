**# team-43**

A **web application** that allows consolidation of data from different sources (provided by a NGO **YUVA PARIVARTAN** as a .csv file) and generate 
category-wise (Student, HR, Impact support, etc.) *visual summary* and *exportable report*. The .csv template provided by the NGO will serve as a 
data blueprint to generate categories and other data points on the UI, for the web application that has been developed.
The application offers a *role-based authorization* (segregate users based on their login ID's into admin, users etc.) to carry out tasks like 
adding categories, alerts, users, etc. The application provides the capability to create categories adhoc and generate alerts based on adhoc thresholds 
created by user like *red alert* if students' attendance fall below 50% etc.
Authorized users are offered the provision to customize the fields (add or remove data-points) on the dashboard.
Reports are generated from different systems and pulled ouut in the form of .pdf files.
